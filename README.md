# CLIQUETV
The CLIQUE TV App is a movement that empowers creators, connects audiences, and redefines digital entertainment. With this initial codebase, developers can build upon the foundation and contribute to GitHub, enhancing features and making CLIQUE TV a revolutionary platform.
Brief History of CLIQUE TV

CLIQUE TV was the first public streaming service, founded in 2000, and began streaming in 2005 while YouTube was still in development. In 2006, Google made a $60K buyout offer, which was turned down by founder Lyndal Spirit. Since then, CLIQUE TV has continued to pioneer the streaming industry, focusing on independent creators, niche content, and community-driven entertainment. It stands as a visionary platform that prioritizes diverse storytelling and interactive engagement.
Why Build the CLIQUE TV App?

As the digital entertainment landscape evolves, CLIQUE TV aims to relaunch with a cutting-edge streaming app that provides a seamless, interactive, and community-focused experience. The app will serve as a central hub for creators, subscribers, and innovators who seek an alternative to mainstream platforms. By leveraging GitHubâ€™s open-source development community, CLIQUE TV invites developers, designers, and media enthusiasts to contribute to building a revolutionary streaming experience that challenges industry norms.
